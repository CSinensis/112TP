Project Description:
- My project is titled Pathfinding Visualizer
- It is an educational app which aims to make pathfinding algorithms easier to understand
- My project allows users to create and save custom graphs and visualize how different pathfinding algorithms traverse through those graphs.
- It also includes a bonus maze generation visualizer for those who are interested. 

How to Run:
- Run main.py and the app should automatically load
- If you want to create a custom graph with image underlay, you will need a link to an image (that is not too long)
- Alternatively, you can use the 'u' shortcut in the custom graph creator if you don't want to find a link

Libraries/Modules:
- PIL/pillow (cmu_112_graphics version should be enough)

Shortcut Commands:
- right/left keys step forwards/backwards in any of the visualization screens
- When making custom graph, pressing 'u' automatically switches to image mode and loads sample image
